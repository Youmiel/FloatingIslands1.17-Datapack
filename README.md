# FloatingIslands-FutureVersion

Future update is not guaranteed, as Mojang constantly changes the format of worldgen data. It's not fun to figure out every single problem you encountered inside an undocumented system.

In addition, as a technical player, I don't like the player chat reporting system and also the update trend of Minecraft.
