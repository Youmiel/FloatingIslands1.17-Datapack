# FloatingIslands-Datapack

A minecraft datapack that creates floating islands in overworld and the nether.

## Features

### Terrain Noise (1.18-)

Terrain noise in `overworld` and `the nether` is similar to `the end`, but sightly changed.

- **(1.16.x)** Overworld sea level has changed to 0 for better vegetation on overworld islands, also avoiding sea ravine from generating in the void

- **(1.17.x)** Overworld sea level has changed to 32 for better vegetation on overworld islands

### Terrain Noise (1.18+)

Overworld terrain noise has completely rewrote to match 1.18 world height. 

Terrain noise in `the nether` is similar to `the end`, but sightly changed.

  - Nether terrain surface is sightly rougher than `the end`

### End Gateways

End gateways are distributed randomly in `overworld` and `the nether`, targeting (0,0).

Below are the biomes that end gateways may generate:
  - deep_ocean
  - desert
  - forest
  - windswept_hills (1.18+) or minecraft:mountains (1.18-)
  - ocean
  - plains
  - savanna
  - swamp
  - taiga
  - basalt_deltas
  - nether_wastes
  - soul_sand_valley
  - **warped_forest** (*highest density*)
  - end_highlands (*vanilla datapack*)

## Usage
